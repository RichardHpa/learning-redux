# Learning Redux

Small project to learn how to use Redux with React JS.   
Following the [Redux For Beginners | React Redux Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY) from [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q)

## Installation
**Please Note**  
This project uses the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), so I recommend installing this before you continue on with the installation.

  $ git clone https://github.com/RichardHpa/learning-redux
  $ cd learning-redux
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
